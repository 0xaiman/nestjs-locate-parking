# Project Name

## Description
A brief description of what your project does and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.)
- **Docker** (Make sure Docker is installed and running.)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary NPM packages:

```
npm install
```
3. Run Docker Compose
Start the Docker containers (e.g., for MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up
```
This will bring up the required services (e.g., databases, caches, etc.) based on the docker-compose.yml file.

4. Run the Application
Now that your Docker containers are running, you can start the application using the following command:

```
npm run start:dev
```
5. Swagger UI
Once the application is up and running, you can view the Swagger UI documentation at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```
Environment Variables
You can configure your environment variables by creating a .env file at the root of the project. Example:

```
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```
